# DataScienceProject

A school data science project done with another student in Matlab and Python. This project main purpose is to use a neural network to recognize alcohol functions from the molecules structural formula.

First, a database full of structural formulas is randomly generated in Python, one-third of it contains alcohol functions. Then, the neural network in Matlab trains itself with the input data, and try to guess if the remaining data contains alcohol or not.

Consider checking the report for more details. The report is currently in french, but an english version may arrive soon.
